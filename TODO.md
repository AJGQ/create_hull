# needs
## sort points
- DoubleLinkedList (good for a previous and next)
- DynamicArray (good for finding middle element, for de divide part)
- sort (maybe to be on the mood merge sort)
- Point (int[2], keep it simple)
- Line (do we really need it?)
- is point left of the line
    - Area of a triangle

## sets
- merge

## discussion
- for a set of points lets use DynamicArray
- for the Hull DoubleLinkedList
- for the point file (number of points \n int int \n ...)

# style
- code style (kebab, camel, ...)
    - snake
- naming (lower cases, upper cases, types, predicates, ...)
    - predicates (when is a good idea prefix is)
    - Camel (Types)
    - macros (upper case)
    - create/destroy
- returning values (do we want to return de result, or just pass a reference)
    - references (majority of times)
- unit testing?
    - ok
- prefix the module name?
    - ok

# document
- md?
- latex?
- lhs?
- (do we need slides?)
