# needs
## sort points
- DoubleLinkedList (good for a previous and next, contradicting DynamicArray)
- DynamicArray (good for finding middle element, for de divide part)
- sort (maybe to be on the mood merge sort)
- Point (int[2], keep it simple)
- Line (do we really need it?)
- is point left of the line
    - Area of a triangle

## sets
- Set (dynamic)
- TreeSet (maybe)
- union
- merge (maybe a TreeSet or an Ordered Array)

# style
- code style (kebab, camel, ...)
- naming (lower cases, upper cases, types, predicates, ...)
- returning values (do we want to return de result, or just pass a reference)
- unit testing?
- prefix the module name?

# document
- md?
- latex?
- lhs?
- (do we need slides?)
